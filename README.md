# LinkedIn-Clone

Created the build of the front page UI of the LinkedIn application.
Also created the login tab for user authentication
The user gets authenticated by firebase. 
The news section in the widgets section dynamically showcases new top headlines of India with the help of NEWS API.
Feel free to clone the application and build upon the UI and the backend.
